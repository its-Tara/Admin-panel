This project is part of my learning journey in css and javascript.
It was created as part of a course/tutorial to reinforce fundamental concepts and gain hands-on experience in frontend development.
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of javascript and gained practical experience in frontend development. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. I'm always eager to learn and improve!
